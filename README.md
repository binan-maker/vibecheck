# Truth & Dare Bottle Prototype

A lightweight Expo prototype for a **digital bottle-spin Truth & Dare game** played in real life.

## What this prototype includes

- Mode selection (Friends, Couples, College, Team)
- Offline prompt engine (Truth / Dare)
- Random player selector (bottle-spin simulation)
- Product clarity page explaining:
  - system vs feature
  - pain solved
  - prototype roadmap

## Why this exists

This MVP focuses on one core loop:

`choose mode → spin bottle → selected player gets Truth or Dare → next turn`

It solves awkward silence and boredom in in-person circles without needing backend/auth complexity.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npx expo start
```
